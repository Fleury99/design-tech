Most "vibecoding" tutorials show you how to build ugly, static pages that look like templates. Today, we are building the real thing: A high-performance "Scrollytelling" portfolio website with cinematic parallax and scroll-linked animation, the kind of site creative agencies charge $10,000+ to build.
I built this entire project in under 10 minutes using a specific Asset Pipeline (Whisk → Antigravity → Vercel). We aren't just prompting a chatbot; we are engineering a production-ready Next.js application using Google Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro) to write the code and Vercel to ship it globally.
If you are tired of "no-code" hype and want to learn actual Applied AI Engineering, this is the workflow.
